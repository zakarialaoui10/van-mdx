__props__:
    counter_start : 10
    border_color : "green"
---
import "highlight.js/styles/1c-light.css";
import Counter, {Comps} from "../components/Counter.js";

# Hello {["World", "Vanjs User"][Math.floor(Math.random()*2)]}

<script>
  let b = 10
  console.log(b)

## Features 

In this demo, we’ll explore **Van-Mdx** by showcasing a counter implemented as an interactive VanJS component.

Before we dive in, let’s go over some key features of ***van-mdx*** : 

- It supports code highlighting, just import a style from **highlight.js** like so:
```js
import "highlight.js/styles/1c-light.css";
```
- It supports props and attributes defined in frontmatter:

```md
---
__props__ :
    counter_start : 10
    background : "tomato"
title : "Van-mdx Interactive Blog"
---
```
The ***van-mdx*** file export the UI component as the default export, and exposes attributes as named exports 

In this example **`counter_start`** and **`background`** are props with default values ***10*** and ***"tomato"***, respectively

This allows you to use it like so :
```js
import InteractiveBlog, {title} from "./article.mdx"
IntercativeBlog({counter_start : 15}) 
```
In this case, the ***counter_start*** prop is **overridden** with the value ***15***, while ***background*** retains its default value.

## Counter Showcases

### Counter Declaration : 

```js
import van from "vanjs-core";

const Counter = ({counter_start = 0, border_color = "darkblue"}={}, ...children) => {
  console.log(`children : ${children}`)
  const { button, div } = van.tags;
  const counter = van.state(counter_start);
  return (
    div(
      {style:
        `width : 200px;
        border : 2px ${border_color} solid; 
        border-radius : 10px;
        display : flex;
        justify-content: center;
        padding : 10px
        `
      },
      button({ onclick: () => ++counter.val }, "Counter: ", counter)
    )
  );
};
export default Counter;
```
### Counter rendering : 

- Keeps The default Value : 
<Counter />
- Override **counter_start** value with explicit value 
<Counter counter_start={150}/>

- Overrides both **counter_start** and **border_color** with values passed as props to the export InteractiveBlog
<Counter counter_start={counter_start} border_color={border_color} >
<p> Nested </p>

**Hello**
<Counter />
</Counter>
