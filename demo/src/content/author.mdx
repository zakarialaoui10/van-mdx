# Author

## Overview

Hi, I’m **Zakaria Elalaoui**, a JavaScript developer focused on frontend development and modern UI architectures.  
I’m the creator and maintainer of **ZikoJS**, a growing JavaScript ecosystem designed to make coding effortless and expressive.

My work centers around:
- UI system architecture
- Developer experience (DX)
- Component design patterns
- Lightweight and scalable frontend tooling

## Contributions to VanJS

I actively contribute to the VanJS ecosystem through independent extensions and tooling built around its minimalist philosophy:

- **van-mdx** : An MDX-powered content layer for VanJS, enabling component-driven documentation and dynamic content integration.

- **ufbr** : An utility-first building and rendering approach that enhances composability and UI structure within VanJS applications.

- **van-i18n** : A lightweight internationalization solution designed specifically for VanJS, focused on simplicity, performance, and developer experience.

## Other Completed Projects

- **ZikoJS** – A modular JavaScript ecosystem  
- Custom UI components and layout systems  
- Experimental MDX-based content systems  
- Frontend tooling and editor integrations
