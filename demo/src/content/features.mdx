# Features

## Simple Integration
Write Markdown as usual, and inject Vanjs components wherever needed.
## Extensible
`Van-Mdx` exports a default functional component, allowing you to call it multiple times with different data, enabling dynamic and versatile use.
## Reusable
## Interleaving

You can use inline markdown elements inside HTML or Vanjs Components

```md
<p>
 ***Hello {name}***
</p>
```
## Frontmatter Support
## Markdown Support
Use standard Markdown syntax for writing content.
## JSX Syntax
Declare component using Vanjs Hyperscript syntax, and render it using JSX
## Props
Pass data to components through props, enabling dynamic rendering and customization of content within your Markdown files.
## ESM
Supports ECMAScript Modules (ESM), allowing you to import and export modules
## Expressions
Van-Mdx lets you use JS expressions inside curly braces, like Hello {name}. These expressions can be full JS programs, as long as they evaluate to something renderable. For example, you can use an IIFE like this:
```js
Hello {(()=>{
    const names = ["world", "everyone"];
    const {length} = names
    return names[Math.floor(Math.random()*length)]
})()}
```
